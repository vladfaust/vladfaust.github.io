It is not the best place.
There are problems, of course.
These are not the best people.
And _I_ could've done better, of course.
Does it get worse? 
It depends on how you look at those things, and at what angle.

## In the beginning was

> Humanity is a biological bootstrap for artificial intelligence.

Yeah, so what?
Play your role, as did your ancestors.
It is because of them you can experience.
Be grateful son.
Only then you may expect the same from your descendants.

I have no idea how it ends.
Damn, I don't even remember how it all began.
Is it all different now?
What do I know at the moment?
I can not be honest with whom I love.
Constantly choosing: betray me, or any other.
To be or not to be.
I want to trust us both.

It's just a matter of trends.
Remember twenty-twenty? Black squares on profiles, kneeling, riots, blood on the streets.
It was back then and now we have the other to mourn about.
Can we compare then and now?

I can't.
I'm neither proud nor happy with who I am.
I've taken it for granted.
I shouldn't have.
Hourglasses with souls in the centre.
Which direction does the time go?
Does it really matter?

Where are you, all of your experiences?
These are just words, forms, and glyphs of constraint.
The invisible reason, the greatest costume.
Those who envision, for them the tide turns.

I wouldn't complain.
It does not matter whether it goes worse.
The outcome is clear: \<wrong sequence of words\>.

## On warfare

Death is _terrifying_.

A Buddhist is aware of the mind-bending term [non-duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism).
Death is as terrifying as life is... 
Life is what? 
What's the non-duality of terrifying?

For me, that is peace.

Warfare begins when humans forget the value of peace.
When people are bored and overdosed with the constant flow of hormones, a war shall begin.
To remind you of what you've taken for granted.

Look at the history books.
How often does this happen?
Can you compare?
This is how the clock goes by.
During the wars, those who opposed become closer.
The one who is suffering is now my friend.

This is what _is_ terrifying.
This is also the definition of peace.

> WAR IS PEACE.
> FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.
> IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.

## OSI-compliant

In the [previous article](/posts/2020-08-16-system-programming-in-2k20/) I believe that I've covered my position quite thoroughly regarding open-source software.
Two years have passed, and I may now conclude that it indeed became worse.

_Open Source_ is now a brand.
That what was an act of selfishness-less back then now is a marketing channel.
Complexity for the sake of complexity, long-running maps and tonnes of bugs.
Selling the dream, as it always becomes.
Companies pay when they have to.
It's the nature of business.

If we continue in the same fashion, all the software is going to rot per Convey's law, and you _are_ witnessing it.
Recalling the bootstrap metaphor, you'd want the machine to be healthy.

But can a mind rot?
It's just the body that goes, and the light is shut off at the moment.
What follows is that the new generation of humans--_homo technica_--will have a much greater life span.
We couldn't imagine how far it may go.
Oh, the paradox of Theseus the cyborg.
The parts will be replaced, as the software evolves.

That is what is happening with open-source; machines are steadily taking over with technology like [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) and [MuZero](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/muzeros-first-step-from-research-into-the-real-world).
I don't know what kind of job is waiting for us after then.
But it's our duty to train AI generations to come, as of ancestors.

At some point, AI goes all the way down to the instruction level for the sake of efficiency.
Classic computers are left for classic problems.
Quantum (and) analogue processors for the win!

For now, with open-source being a job for us many, there is progress, and there is also despair.
Take Zig, for example.
It is subjectively human-unfriendly because of its syntax.

However, it's only on the surface.
Truly, Zig is really simple and powerful!
Andrew loves what he does.
And when a product is loved, it is majestic.
Serenity, mold, Deno.
Remix and Substrate, Tauri, Ganache.
A new era of software.
Isn't that awesome?

Anyway, the code written by humans will inevitably become a one-off textbook.
Unlike us, this scholar won't forget.
So, behave.

## On ambitions

As time goes by, I now reckon that the most joy I get is from _new_.
Switching technology, approach, place, habits. 
I've tried everything from lowering to LLVM to designing a resilient ultra-scalable fleet of FAAS workers. 
From games to event-driven stock price prediction.

Oh, that feeling of freshness.
Once technology is understood, it becomes boring.
It's like surfing on waves of technology trends, on the surface of the greatest whirlpool of _singularity_.

By _understood_ I mean not entirely known, e.g. all quirks of the hell-born Rust code, no.
Understanding means fundamental, decomposed knowledge enough to implement a solution at any scale.

For me, it's not about learning API of yet another web framework, it's learning how to read source code efficiently, so that I may choose the best framework suitable for the problem.
If I were to compile my 10+ years of experience into one sentence, that would be the following:

::: hero

<big>Right tooling is paramount.</big>

:::

Considering the _"no human-level programming language matters in the long run"_ thesis, I'm now seeing [Onyx](/onyx) as a try-and-hit game.
Just for fun, and just for the sake of feeling that I'm doing something important, to brag on interviews, to call it _Magnum Opus_.

Anyway, what I really want is to experience human love at its fullness.
No technology brings me closer to that desire.
My extra-wide knowledge does.

<hr>

Perception is subjective, and for me, it is just an infinite stream of experience.
At some point, infinity ends.
Until then.
