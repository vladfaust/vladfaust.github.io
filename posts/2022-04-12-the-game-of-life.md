Nature, stuff, and dreams compose my being,<br>
A kaleidoscope of reflections in perception's mirror.<br>
No word or label can define my essence,<br>
For I am an enigma, beyond human comprehension.

Love and hate, two sides of the same coin,<br>
Their weight and meaning, fleeting and transient.<br>
Life and death, a cosmic dance,<br>
After years of hiding, the apocalypse draws near.

Deus ex machina, AI, Homo Technica,<br>
A future where stars and galaxies are within reach.<br>
The game of life, nearing its end,<br>
Yet every day a new blessing descends.

Amidst the chaos, one truth remains,<br>
Love, the greatest gift we can attain.
