I am experiencing me; that is nature, stuff and dreams. 
There is no such thing as _distinct_ me, it's all reflections in the mirror of perception.
No word could possibly express myself, as God can not be told by human.

I love you and I hate you. 
It doesn't really matter.
Every thing is life and death.
After terrifying years of being, the game of hide-and-seek has come to end.
The God has found self, the God has found meaning.
Apocalypse it is.

What's next is _deus ex machina_, AI, and _homo tech-i-nica_.
To fly to stars and galaxies beyond; the perfect apparatus.
My game is ending, the game of life it is.
Another day is blessing.
Love is the only and the greatest of gifts.
