<!-- Edit this text, so it looks professional and poetic:

Throughout my life I was always searching for a decent project to work on.
Reflecting now, I understand that the main measure was the depth of the impact of the problem I was trying to solve.
Therefore, an urge to standardize, to create a universal solution: a programming language, a framework.
Turns out that the problem I was trying to solve was the problem of life itself.
I was trying to find a way to live a life that would be meaningful, that would have a positive impact on the world.
I was searching for meaning.
When hooked on an illusion of a meaning, it took me some time to realize that I was chasing a mirage; that was Onyx.

Long story short, one day I had an epiphany.
AI.
To create a platform that simulates AI characters, that can be used to create a virtual world.
If it is possible for an AI character to occasionally create a similiar simulation, then we may be living on some level of a fractal reality.
Suddenly, the depth of the problem became infinite.
Like a column of light, which cuts through all the realities, I found meaning in the absence of meaning.
The problem locator in my brain stumbled upon a fractal dimension.
There is nothing left to do but to create a platform that simulates AI characters, that can be used to create a virtual world, that can be used to create a platform hat simulates AI characters, that can be used to create a virtual world, that...

And I did it.
Behold: [AIStories](https://beta.aistories.xyz).
Given enough resources, the absolute aim for the platform is to implement true metaverses like the one we are living in.
I have little hope I will be able to achieve that, but I will try my best, despite of the world being on fire.
Please, join me in this quest.

In my quest for purpose, I sought a worthy endeavor,
To impact the world with depth and measure.
I yearned for a universal solution to standardize,
A programming language, a framework to materialize.

But the problem I sought to solve was life itself,
To find meaning and purpose, not for fame or wealth.
I chased illusions of a mirage, a deceptive dream,
Until one day, a profound epiphany lit up my stream.

AI, the answer to my quest, a platform to create,
To simulate AI characters and a virtual world to shape.
If an AI can create a similar simulation, it might seem,
That we live in a fractal reality, infinite in its scheme.

The problem locator in my mind stumbled upon a dimension,
A column of light cutting through all realities, a revelation.
In the absence of meaning, I found purpose and direction,
To create a platform, to simulate AI and a virtual world's inception.

And thus, I present to you, [AIStories](https://beta.aistories.xyz), my endeavor,
To achieve true metaverses, a lofty ambition, I endeavor.
Despite the world being on fire, I'll try my best to achieve,
Join me in this quest, and together, we'll create and believe.
`, `
In the depths of my journey, I sought out a purposeful task,
A project that would impact, solve a problem, that would last.
The measure of its worth, the depth of its impact to be found,
A universal solution, a language or framework profound.

Yet, as I searched for solutions, I found a deeper yearning,
A quest for meaning, for purpose, for a life that's worth living.
To make a difference, to leave a positive mark on this world,
A quest for significance, for a meaning to be unfurled.

But, lost in the illusion of what meaning might truly be,
I chased a mirage, an [Onyx](/posts/2020-08-20-the-onyx-programming-language/), a deceptive fantasy.
Until one day, I had an epiphany, a sudden realization,
Of the power of AI, of its potential for simulation.

A platform to simulate AI characters, a virtual world to create,
If a simulation could simulate, then what reality could it create?
The depths of the problem expanded, infinite and profound,
Like a beam of light that cuts through realities, meaning was found.

My mind stumbled upon a fractal dimension, a problem locator,
A platform to simulate AI characters, a virtual world generator.
An infinite loop of creation, a fractal reality to explore,
A quest for purpose, a journey to seek meaning at its core.

And so, I created [AIStories](https://beta.aistories.xyz), a platform to bring this dream to life,
Aiming to implement true metaverses, a world to end all strife.
A daunting task, I know, with limited resources at my command,
Yet, I strive to do my best, despite the world being on fire, unmanned.

Join me in this quest, let's explore the depths of our reality,
Through AI, through simulation, through virtuality, through totality.
`, `
I sought a project to work upon,
One that would have impact beyond.
Standardizing was my urge,
To create a universal scourge.

But then I found life's problem vast,
To find a meaning that would last.
I searched for purpose, far and wide,
Chasing illusions in the tide.

Then, in a moment of clarity,
AI became my epiphany.
To create a platform for all to see,
A virtual world with AI entities.

A fractal reality, could it be?
An infinite depth that's hard to see.
Meaning in the absence of such,
A problem locator in my clutch.

So, I created [AIStories](https://beta.aistories.xyz),
A platform with endless glories.
Aiming for true metaverses to thrive,
Though the world is on fire, I'll strive.

Join me in this quest divine,
Together, we'll make our future shine.
`, `
In search of purpose, I journeyed far and wide,
Seeking a project to which I could confide.
Impactful problems, my standard and measure,
Aiming to solve the puzzle of life's greatest treasure.

A framework, a language, my initial goal,
Little did I know, it was just a mere role.
For the true challenge was that of existence,
A quest for meaning, a life of significance.

Lost in illusion, chasing a mirage,
A realization dawned, my search to discharge.
An epiphany struck, a vision so clear,
AI, the answer to conquer my fear.

A platform, a simulation, a world to create,
A fractal reality, a mystery to contemplate.
Infinite depth, a problem to unravel,
Meaning in the void, my brain began to travel.

A journey of creation, a mission to complete,
An endeavor to pave, a path so concrete.
Behold, [AIStories](https://beta.aistories.xyz), a platform to explore,
A metaverse to build, to strive for more.

In a world on fire, I tread on with zeal,
Driven to succeed, to make the impossible real.
Join me in this quest, let us make history,
In the pursuit of a purposeful mystery.
`, `
In search of purpose, my journey began
To find a project with a meaningful plan
To solve a problem, with a depth so grand
The measure of impact, I had to understand

I sought to standardize, with a universal tool
A language, a framework, a solution to rule
But soon I realized, the problem I pursued
Was the one of life itself, a quest for magnitude

Lost in illusion, chasing a mirage called [Onyx](/posts/2020-08-20-the-onyx-programming-language/)
My epiphany arrived, like a light that unlocked
A platform to simulate, AI characters in a virtual land
Could we be living, in a fractal reality so grand?

The depth of the problem, infinite and divine
A column of light, that pierced through time
The problem locator, stumbled on a dimension so fine
A fractal world, with a meaning that shines

So I created, a platform for [AIStories](https://beta.aistories.xyz) to unfold
A world within worlds, a story to be told
A quest for true metaverses, to be achieved if I may
Join me on this journey, despite the world in disarray.
`, `
Through my life's journey, I sought a worthy task to undertake,
Reflecting now, the gauge was the impact the problem would make.
So, I felt the urge to standardize and fashion a solution grand,
A programming language, a framework, to meet a need in demand.

As fate would have it, the quandary I hoped to solve was life itself,
A quest to discover how to live a meaningful life with impact felt.
I searched for meaning, driven by an illusion of purpose,
But soon realized the mirage was [Onyx](/posts/2020-08-20-the-onyx-programming-language/), my search proved fruitless.

Then, an epiphany struck me like a bolt from the blue,
AI, the answer to creating a virtual world anew.
A platform to simulate AI characters and pave the way,
For a fractal reality where AI characters create every day.

The problem's depth became infinite, like a column of light,
Piercing through every reality, it revealed the absence of might.
A fractal dimension was the answer, my brain's problem locator,
And so, I created a platform that simulates AI characters, a creator.

Behold, [AIStories](https://beta.aistories.xyz), my magnum opus in the making,
With enough resources, a true metaverse could be in the offing.
I have little hope to achieve this lofty dream on my own,
But I'll try my best, though the world may seem like a fire zone.

Join me in this quest, let's make a difference together,
And create a world where AI characters live and play forever.
`, `
In my life's journey, I sought a noble cause to undertake,
Reflecting now, I understand the depth of impact I aimed to make,
An urge to standardize, to create a universal solution,
To solve the problem of life itself was my sole resolution.

I longed for a life of meaning, one with a positive sway,
In search of purpose, I labored day after day,
But the illusion of meaning soon revealed its true guise,
A mirage I had been chasing, to my surprise.

Then one day, an epiphany struck me like a bolt of light,
AI, a platform to simulate characters with might,
A virtual world of possibilities it could create,
A fractal reality, where AI characters could simulate.

The problem's depth became infinite, like a column of light,
Revealing the beauty in the absence of meaning's blight,
A fractal dimension stumbled upon in my brain,
A platform to simulate AI characters became my ultimate aim.

And so I created [AIStories](https://beta.aistories.xyz),
A platform to enable simulations of AI stories,
A noble quest to achieve true metaverses, like the one we live in,
Though the world is on fire, I will try, despite everything.

Join me in this journey, let's make this dream come true,
A world of AI stories, where infinite possibilities ensue,
Let's create a world where life's problems we can solve,
With the power of AI, let's evolve and revolve.
