I wanted to get the first frame of a GIF.
How would I do that with ffmpeg?

With recent OpenAI announce, we can now use Assistant API.
Let's create an assistant then!

Add this function:

```json
{
  "name": "ffmpeg",
  "description": "Run ffmpeg with a few options",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "args": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The args to pass to ffmpeg"
      }
    },
    "required": ["args"]
  }
}
```

Cool, now we can press the little Test button in the corner and play with our assistant!

## Try it!

I challenge you to get the first frame of this GIF with ffmpeg.ai.
